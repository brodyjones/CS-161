Our graph_to_sat program correctly converted our two graph coloring problems into SAT instances
an example output from the graph1_3colors.txt file is:

p cnf 21 64
-1 -2 0
-1 -3 0
-2 -3 0
1 2 3 0
-4 -5 0
-4 -6 0
-5 -6 0
4 5 6 0
-7 -8 0
-7 -9 0
-8 -9 0
7 8 9 0

We can then upload these text files to a remote server where we have our rsat solver installed
Running these SAT instances gave us the following outputs

Graph 1 was not satisfiable on an input of three colors, the solver outputted false

When we expended the problem to be a 4-color problem, graph 1 was satisfiable with the output:
-1 -2 -3 4    // node 1 recieves color 4
-5 -6 7 -8    // node 2 recieves color 3
-9 10 -11 -12   // node 3 recieves color 2
-13 -14 15 -16   // node 4 recieves color 3
17 -18 -19 -20   // node 5 recieves color 1
-21 22 -23 -24   // node 6 recieves color 2
25 -26 -27 -28   // node 7 recieves color 1

From these two results, we can understand that this graph is k colorable iff k >= 4
based on the results of Rsat, the above coloring would be a satisfactory solution to this problem

I tried this again with the denser graph 2 and ran the Rsat on k = 3 colors,
and then incrementally increased k until the graph problem was satisfiable.

we found that k = 8 was the minimum number of colors needed to color graph 2 completely.
